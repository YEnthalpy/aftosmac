\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula expression, of the form \code{response ~ predictors}.
The \code{response} is a \code{Surv} object with right censoring.}

in the \code{formula}.}

\item{size.pilot}{the pilot subsample size}

\item{size.subsample}{the subsample size which is always much large than
the pilot subsample size}

\item{sspType}{the type of subsampling probabilities (SSPs). Three types of
    SSPs are provided:
\describe{
  \item{\code{uniform}}{the uniform SSPs.}
  \item{\code{optA}}{the A-optimal SSPs, always yields the least mean square errors.}
  \item{\code{optL}}{the L-optimal SSPs which is less time-consuming than the A-optimal SSPs.}

\item{model}{regression model to fit the data:

  \item{\code{weibull}}{the Weibull parametric AFT model.}
  \item{\code{ls}}{the least-square based semi-parametric AFT model.}
  \item{\code{rank}}{the rank based semi-parametric AFT model which requires much less subsample
                      size to get a converging results than the least-squares approach.}

\item{combine}{methods to combine the results by the pilot sample and the subsample:

\item{repeated}{number of subsmaples used to derive the final estimator. The
default is set to be \code{repeated = 1}. When \code{repeated > 1}, the

User is suggested to use multiple subsamples (\code{repeated > 1}) only
for the least-squares based semi-prarmetric AFT model whose slope matrix
is estimated by a resampling method. And the corresponding
sandwich estimator will overestimate the variance when the censoring
rate is high censoring rate. Moreover, when \code{repeated > 1}, only the
variance matrix with respect to the full sample estimator can be estimated.
Moreover, \code{repeated} should be larger than the number of covariates \code{p}.}

\description{
Fit a accelerated failure time (AFT) model based on a small subsample.
The subsample is chosen by sampling with resampling. The subsampling probabilities (SSPs)
are derived by the A-optimal and L-optimal criteria from the optimal design of
experiment. Three types of models are supported, the Weibull parametric AFT model,
the rank-based semi-parametric AFT model and the least-squares based semi-parametric
AFT model with the Gehan's weight.
}
\details{
The estimating equation is solved by
a block gradient decent method for the Weibull AFT model and by an iterative approach
for the least-squares based semi-prarmetric AFT model.
For the rank-based semi-parametric AFT model, the non-smooth estimating equation
is smoothed by an induced smooth procedure which is solved the
by the Quasi Newton's method implemented as \code{nleqslv} in the package \pkg{nleqslv}.

When \code{repeated = 1}, the variance matrix is estimated by a sandwich form
\deqn{\Sigma = A^{-1}V(A^{-1})^T,} where \eqn{V} is the asymptotic variance of
the estimating function and \eqn{A} is the slope matrix. The sandwich estimator
estimates the variance matrix well for the Weibull parametric AFT model and the rank-based
semi-prarmetric AFT model. For the least-squares based semi-prarmetric AFT
model whose slope matrix
is estimated by a resampling method. And the corresponding
sandwich estimator will overestimate the variance when the censoring
rate is high censoring rate. We fix this specific problem for the least-squares based approach
by selecting more than one subsample (\code{repeated > 1}) to estimate the variance matrix
directly by multiple subsample estimators.
The variance matrix with respect to the full data estimator
is calculated used these estimators instead of using the sandwich form.
Moreover, when \code{se = "parTrue"}, we estimate the
variance matrix with respect to the true regression coefficient and when
\code{se = "parFull"}, the variance matrix with respect to the full data estimator
is evaluated.

The optimal SSPs are estimated by a pilot estimator using a small pilot subsample.
The subsample estimator is derived by the subsample chosed based on the estimated
optimal SSPs. To enhance the estimation accuracy, the pilot estimator and the subsample
estimator need to be combined. We provided two methods for combination. When
\code{combine = "sample"}, the pilot sample and the subsample sample are combined to
derived the final estimator. When \code{combine = "estimator"}, the pilot estimator
and the subsample estimator is combined to derived the final estimator. The second
method is less time-consuming and is always used in the divide-and-conquer approach.
